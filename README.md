# Monkey-Quest
Senior Capstone project game created in Unity. I've included only the scripts in this repository, as the game itself uses licensed assets. The game is not meant for distribution and is merely an educational project, which I used to research Unity and various algorithm structures.

This is a turn-based game featuring a procedurally generated map. The turn-based combat is fully functional, and enemies take their turns automatically. I designed the procedural generation algorithm for the maze myself, it is based on maze generation algorithms, knn algorithms, and draws inspiration from other procedurally generated video games.

Many of the "room types"(nodes that are generated in the maze) are not yet functional.
